## Vision & Concept

### Tagline
"Your Domes Await - One profile. Five communities. Endless authentic connections."

### Core Concept
Domeo recognizes that people are multifaceted. Unlike traditional dating apps that force users into one box, Domeo provides five distinct "domes" (communities) where users can express different aspects of themselves while maintaining complete privacy between spaces.

### Key Differentiators
1. **One Verified Profile**: Create once, use across all domes
2. **Five Distinct Communities**: Each with its own culture and purpose
3. **Complete Privacy Control**: Your activities in each dome stay separate
4. **100% Verified Users**: AI + human verification for every member
5. **Transparent Pricing**: One price, all features, no hidden costs

---

## Problem & Solution

### Problems with Current Dating Apps
1. **Mixed Intentions**: Hookups next to serious relationships in same feed
2. **Fake Profiles**: Catfishing, bots, heavily filtered photos
3. **No Privacy**: Your ex, boss, and family can all find you
4. **Hidden Costs**: Pay extra for basic features
5. **One-Dimensional**: Can't express different sides of yourself

### Domeo's Solution
- **Intention-Based Communities**: Each dome has clear purpose
- **Verified Authenticity**: Multi-step verification process
- **Compartmentalized Privacy**: What happens in each dome stays there
- **Fair Pricing**: $29/month for everything
- **Multifaceted Profiles**: Be your whole self across different spaces

## UX Philosophy

   - Dome separation
   - Granular controls

3. **Authentic Expression**
   - Different profile aspects per dome
   - No singular "best self" pressure
   - Honest intention setting

4. **Premium Experience**
   - No ads ever

## Business Model

### Pricing Strategy
- **Founding Members**: First 5,000 get 3 months free, then $29/mo
- **Regular Price**: $29/month or $290/year
- **No Tiers**: One price, full access

### Revenue Projections
- Target: 5,000 founding members in 6 months
- Year 1: 25,000 members = $7.25M ARR
- Year 2: 100,000 members = $29M ARR

### Why This Works
1. **Premium Positioning**: Higher price = serious users
2. **No Nickel-and-Diming**: Everything included builds trust
3. **Founding Member Scarcity**: Creates urgency
4. **Multi-Dome Value**: 5 apps in one justifies price

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: [To be decided - Node.js/Python suggested]
